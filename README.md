This is more advanced project and pratcie to MERN stack( without the frontend(React.js))
but still a strong practice to develop my backend skills and practice APIs
and understanding the structure of projects as for the testing phase I purely worked with insomnia software to test the funcionality of my app and it security
there's still many aspect to enhance in this project and i really loo forward to do it and i hope the people who read this project find it helpful.
